# Parched And Bogged 
This is a simple that adds the Dune with plans to add more vanilla-like mob variations based on new mojangs new Parched and not-so-new Bogged, Husk and Stray mobs.
## Dune

The Dune is the first mob of the mod. A creeper variant that tries to bury you under piles of sand. What more could you want? But keep them away from the wind charges — they can absorb them and gain the power to move solid blocks!
